# Face-Recognition-based-Attendance-system
This project develops a real-time face recognition-based attendance system using Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It captures and identifies faces to automatically mark attendance, offering a contactless, accurate, and efficient solution for schools, colleges, and offices.
